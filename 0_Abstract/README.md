Dustbin is a container which collects garbage’s or stores items which are recyclable or non-recyclable, decompose and non-decompose. They are usually used in homes, office etc, but in case they are full no one is there to clean it and the garbage are spilled out. The surrounding of a dustbin is conducive and it increases the pollution level. Air pollution due to a garbage’s in dustbin can produce bacteria and virus which can cause spread of harmful diseases for human. Therefore, a smart dustbin is designed. The main objective of the project is to design a smart dustbin which will help in keeping our environment clean and also eco-friendly. This smart dustbin management system is built on the microcontroller-based system having ultrasonic sensor on the dustbin. If dustbin is not maintained then it can cause an unhealthy environment and create pollution that affect our health.
