# Garbage level indicator
## INTRODUCTION
Dustbin is a container which collects garbage’s or stores items which are recyclable or non-recyclable, decompose and non-decompose. They are usually used in homes, office etc, but in case they are full no one is there to clean it and the garbage are spilled out. The surrounding of a dustbin is conducive and it increases the pollution level. Air pollution due to a garbage’s in dustbin can produce bacteria and virus which can cause spread of harmful diseases for human. Therefore, a smart dustbin is designed.
## OBJECTIVE
The main objective of the project is to design a smart dustbin which will help in keeping our environment clean and also eco-friendly. This smart dustbin management system is built on the microcontroller-based system having ultrasonic sensor on the dustbin. If dustbin is not maintained then it can cause an unhealthy environment and create pollution that affect our health.

## BENIFITS
- It improves street hygiene and safety.
- Easy installation
- Minimal maintenance
- Compact design
## COMPONENTS
- ATMEGA328p
- Ultrasonic sensor
- LEDs
- Resistors
## 4W's And 1H
## Who
In our day to day activities, it is common to all to have smart dustbin in home, office, restaurants etc.
## What
The Smart dustbin employs a simple mechanism to detect and indicate the level of garbage in the dustbin.
## When
Smart dustbin is a system that indicates information about the level of garbage’s. This level indication is very useful to dispose the waste in correct time.
## Where
Smart dustbin is used in homes, office, restaurants, etc.
## How
This project is implemented in Embedded C language. The working principle of a smart dustbin is actually quite simple. Garbage level indication is implemented by using ATMEGA328, ultrasonic sensor and LEDs.
